              | Friction Stir Welding Laboratory (FSW Lab) at the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur 
              | has been developed under the leadership of Prof. Surjya K Pal. 
              | It is one of the vibrant laboratories of IIT Kharagpur, presently constituting a team of 
              | fifteen doctoral scholars, and four postgraduate scholars.               
              | Research spans from improvisation of the welding process, mechanical and metallurgical characterizations, 
              | implementation of Industry 4.0 concepts for real time monitoring and control, and numerical modeling and simulation. 
              | The laboratory houses several state-of-the-art facilities such as CNC and robotic FSW machines, 
              | sophisticated sensors e.g., piezoelectric rotating dynamometer, thermal imager, vibration, and power sensors.
              | The laboratory provides experimental support to many institutions in India and Aborad on a regular basis. 
              | There is a huge inflow of interns from several institutions across the nation in summer and winter seasons.
              | The lab has also got a strong active research collaboration with the industry.
