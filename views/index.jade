              | The Friction Stir Welding Laboratory at Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur of the Department of Mechanical Engineering
              | is being developed under the leadership of Prof. Surjya Kanta Pal. It is one of the vibrant laboratories of this institute, presently constituting of a
              | team of fifteen doctoral scholars, and four postgraduate scholars working on different aspects of friction stir welding process.
              | The research at this laboratory spans from improvisation of the welding process from mechanical aspect, proofing of those concepts
              | by mechanical and metallurgical characterizations, applying concepts of Industry 4.0 to friction stir welding, and modeling and simulation
              | of the processing through finite element methods. The laboratory houses several state-of-the-art facilities for carrying out friction
              | stir welding including several CNC and robotic facilities, followed by few facilities on sample preparation, sensors such as power meters, vibration, thermal imager, and
              | piezoelectric dynamometer. The laboratory has an inflow of students as interns from several institutions across the nation and
              | abroad in summer and winter seasons.

              | Friction stir welding is an advanced welding technique, and has got a huge potential to cater the industrial needs. 
              We are exploring different avenues to improvise the efficiency of the process by developing in-house welding tools, 
              model for monitoring and controlling the process in real time, exploring welding of different materials in 
              several geometries. We invite industries to visit our state-of-the-art laboratory for collaborative research works.
